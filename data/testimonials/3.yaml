text: "The diversity of people, culture, and knowledge are my favorite parts of the SerresTech community. The speakers do not only work in Greece but come from different countries all around the world. Apart from the presentations, the community organizes career days and Hackathon competitions which are helpful and fun. The SerresTech community is the best home for every junior and senior IT professional who wants to expand his knowledge and meet new people."
