text: "The diversity of people, culture, and knowledge are my favorite parts of SerresTech community.  The speakers do not only work in Greece but in different countries all around the world. Apart from the presentations, the community organizes carrier days and Hackathon competition which are helpful and fun. SerresTech community is the best home for every junior and professional related to the IT industry who wants to expand his knowledge and meet new people."
