This presentation will provide an introduction to [CERN](https://home.cern)
and its operations, focusing on software development and the various
opportunities available.

Afterward there will be a dive into the development process which is followed
on the applications, presenting the various technologies, frameworks and
practices followed.

Moreover we will dive into the Accelerators Logging Service one of the major
big data projects at CERN and will demonstrate data analysis with
[Spark](https://spark.apache.org) on [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) (Jupyter).

all these systems together.
