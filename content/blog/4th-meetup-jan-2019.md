We are welcoming 2019 with a mini-conference and presenters from three different countries and two different continents!

This time we will host three different talks in a mini conference meetup on Saturday:

1. A talk on **Java security architecture**, by **Martin Toshev**, member of the Bulgarian Java User Group and Software Architect at Resolve Systems
2. **Agile Testing Practices**, with examples on Java, by **John Pourdanis**, Test Automation Engineer, ISTQB Certified Tester working at Pheron LTD (SchooX group).
3. How (not) to produce Software, and the **intricacies of the team** by **Dimos Madarakis**, Software Engineer at Tokyo, Japan (tele-conferencing)

We will be especially happy to have participants from other meetups, or any working software engineers that would like to expand their horizons.
