      <description>After two months live we finally found out some time to integrate our Hugo built website with Netlify CMS as also as serve the website from Netlify.
So, yes, we are proud of it and we are very happy to be able to have an Admin Dashboard to create blog posts.
Stay tuned, we may have a presentation on our Meetup about Netlify, Hugo and Jamstack soon!</description>
