      <description>If you are interested to make a presentation, a workshop or any other talk related to our community interests feel free to submit the &amp;ldquo;Call for Speakers&amp;rdquo; form here.
The submissions will help us organize better our meetups.
 The events take place in the city of Serres in Greece mostly in the evening hours. We are open to any dates and topics. Professional speakers from abroad may have extra benefits such as lanches, accomodation, travel tickets etc.</description>
